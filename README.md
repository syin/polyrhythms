# polyrhythms

__polyrhythms__ is a simple webapp that helps you practice polyrhythms on piano. One common polyrhythm is the 4:3 cross-rhythm, which makes up a large proportion of Chopin's [Fantaisie-Impromptu op. posth. 66](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75x6DncZDgI):

Currently __polyrhythms__ requires keyboard input, so it is best viewed on desktop with sound on.
