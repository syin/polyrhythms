<title>MusiSync font character map. Version 4 - final</title>

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.25em; color:#990000">MusiSync font - Version 4 - final</p>

<p>The <b>MusiSync </b>font is simple: Install it, and choose symbols. Each symbol is self-contained. It includes
standard notes as well as the X-head type. This font is free, and is freely redistributable. It is Latin encoded,
so it may be used in word processing documents, PDF files, and web pages (if the recipient has the font installed).<br />
<br />
The font is best viewed with a 16-column, magnifying character map utility such as the free <b>Typecase</b> (for Windows), which can be located on the Internet. Your computer's built-in character map suffices, but the symbols may not appear large enough to discern.<br />
<br />
<b>MusiSync </b>does not place staff lines, nor does
it show pitch. It is intended for learning the rhythm of songs, so the shortest duration note is the 1/16. Many
different timing relationships can be depicted. Some of the symbols depict measure bars, ties, or ties that span
measures.<br />
<br />
This is version 4 of this font. No further changes are anticipated for the common character locations. There are several minor variations of this font (versions 4.xx, where xx indicates a sub-version number). The variations have different symbols in the dark grey area shown in the font map, below. Also, characters in the dark grey locations may not be usable on non-Windows platforms.</p>

<p><b>MusiSync </b>was designed for Windows. It also works on Linux (verified using Knoppix 3.6), and probably will work on Mac OS-X (unverified), but not on Mac prior to OS-X.</p>
